=======================
Time Series Forecasting
=======================

In this example, we use a feature representation pipeline to forecast a continuous time series
target with a regressor.

The algorithm is trained from the target from the features and targets in the training set.
Then predict (future segments) from the features in the test set.

We do not sequentially retrain the algorithm as we move through the test set - which is an
approach you will sometimes see with time series forecasting (and which may or may not be
useful in your application).
